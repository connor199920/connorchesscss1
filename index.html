  <h1>Connor's Chess Website</h1>
  <p>This website links to the best chess resources and explains why you should use them. By the end of this guide, you'll be able to navigate all the major chess websites online and understand which is best for you. I started playing chess around 3 years ago, and since then I have been continually looking for new chess websites and resources to help improve my game. The 4 websites below I have found to be the most helpful in my development. All of these websites have free aspects, but some do come with premium features you need to pay for. The websites below are ranked from best to worst <em>in my opinion,</em> but I do think all of these websites are great, and you should give each one a try.</p>
