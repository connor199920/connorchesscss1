  <h1>Lichess</h1>
  <p>Lichess is a free, open-source, and ad-free chess platform that has quickly become one of the most popular alternatives to other chess websites. With over 150,000 daily active users, Lichess is built by the chess community for the chess community. Unlike many other chess sites, Lichess is completely free with no paywalls or subscriptions required. It’s an excellent resource for both casual players and competitive enthusiasts who want to enjoy chess without interruptions. Lichess was the website where I learned to play chess, and I really benefited from the free analysis and the great structure of the website. You can choose to become a Lichess patron if you'd like to give back to the website, although you will get all the same perks either way.</p>
